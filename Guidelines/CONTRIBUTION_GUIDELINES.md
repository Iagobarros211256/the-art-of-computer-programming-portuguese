Thank you for your interest in contributing to the translation of "The Art of Computer Programming" into Portuguese! Your contributions are invaluable to the success of this project. Before getting started, please take a moment to review the following guidelines:

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
    
    ```
    git clone <https://github.com/toledomateus/the-art-of-computer-programming-portuguese.git>
    
    ```
    
2. **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch for your translations using a descriptive name. We follow the same pattern suggested by GitHub:
- Feature branch: for adding new text
- Fix branch: to fix some text

```
git checkout -b <your-branch-type>-<vol.number>-<chapter-start:?chapter-finish>
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b feature-v1-c1

git checkout -b feature-v2-c3-c4

git checkout -b feature-v1-c1.1-c1.4
```

## Translation Guidelines

1. **Maintain Accuracy:** Ensure that your translations accurately convey the meaning and intent of the original text.
2. **Be Consistent:** Maintain consistency in terminology, style, and formatting throughout your translations.
3. **Preserve Formatting:** Preserve the formatting of code snippets, equations, and other technical elements from the original text.
4. **Translate Footnotes:** Translate any footnotes or annotations included in the text, providing context where necessary.
5. **Use Markdown:** Write your translations using Markdown format, following the same structure as the original text. We will use [this syntax standard](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
